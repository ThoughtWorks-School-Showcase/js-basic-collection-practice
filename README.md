## Practice Requirements:
* Pass all tests
* No high order functions

* Coding with shortcuts

## Practice Output:
You can find detailed requirements in the test code comments under `spec\section-n` directory. And you should put your code in the directory `main`.
For example, the production code corresponds `spec/section-1/practice-1-spec.js` goes into `main/section-1/practice-1.js`.
